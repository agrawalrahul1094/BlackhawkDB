------------------------------

Let's follow a particular naming convention and working technique to ease the development process.

- Always save the important queries which are executed successfully.
- Follow the naming convention strictly 
  For e.g. a script.sql file containing code for creating a table should be named as [table-name]_table.sql
- Always work on your own branch. Do not clutter the master branch.
- Perform Push/Pull daily, even when you're not writing any new code.
